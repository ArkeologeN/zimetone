========

Team &amp; Group based collaborative info dashboard. This project helps to make a public collaboration b/w public teams who are far away in different nations, countries, cities etc.


Local Configuration
-------------

We love contribution! We write public codes. To get started, simply clone the code like:

	$ git clone https://github.com/ArkeologeN/zimetone.git
	$ cd zimetone && ls -l

You'll see that node_modules directory is missing. Now, run the following command:

	$ sudo npm install

This will start the installation process of dependent modules. After that, simple run the express server:

	$ sudo node app


Whoa! It works!
